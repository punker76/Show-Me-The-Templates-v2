Show Me The Templates v2
========================

A newer version adapted from the original [Show Me The Templates!](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/posts/details/2091) created by by Chris Sells & Ian Griffiths as part of their book, [Programming WPF](http://sellsbrothers.com/writing/wpfbook/). 

With Show Me The Templates v2 you can get templates for controls built into WPF for all 5 themes. With this it's easy to start style or re-style your own templates.
